# Bank-Loan-Analysis-Using-SQL
SQL
🔍 Project Title: Bank Loan Analysis Using SQL
💻 Tools & Technologies: SQL, MySQL Workbench, Excel

📌 Problem Statement:
Banks and financial institutions handle thousands of loan applications every month. However, differentiating good loans from bad loans, evaluating borrower performance, and ensuring efficient loan disbursement and repayment tracking are critical challenges.
This project addresses the need for a structured and data-driven way to:

Classify and analyze Good vs. Bad loans based on repayment history

Monitor loan performance metrics to improve lending strategies

Provide granular insights through SQL-based queries and reporting

🛠 Project Approach:
Using SQL, I performed in-depth data analysis on a loan dataset to build a report that provides clarity on:

✅ Good Loan Metrics:

Good Loan Application Percentage

Number of Good Loan Applications

Funded Amount for Good Loans

Total Amount Received from Good Loans

✅ Bad Loan Metrics:

Bad Loan Application Percentage

Number of Bad Loan Applications

Funded Amount for Bad Loans

Total Amount Received from Bad Loans

📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) calculated using SQL:

Total Loan Applications – MTD and MoM tracking

Total Funded Amount – understanding disbursed capital

Total Amount Received – measuring repayment collection

Average Interest Rate – portfolio lending cost insight

Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) – borrower risk assessment

📊 Outcome:
This analysis enables stakeholders to make data-driven decisions regarding loan approval policies, risk control, and overall portfolio management. The structured SQL reporting ensures high scalability for integration into BI dashboards or executive reports.

🔗 Next Steps: Can be extended to Power BI/Tableau dashboards for visualization and automated reporting
